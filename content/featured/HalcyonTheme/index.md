Got invited by Google for its secret hiring challenge known as [Foobar Challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/). I was able to solve it till [Level 3](https://github.com/OjasviChauhan/Google-Foobar).
<br/>
Starting levels were easy but yeah, the last question was damn difficult for me, which nearly took 4 days to solve it.
